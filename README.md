PingPanda checks one URL or a list of URLs and groups the results by HTTP status class. It is a small command-line tool for developers, students, and anyone who wants a quick overview of whether a set of websites is reachable, redirecting, or returning an error.

PingPanda started as [Status Checker](https://github.com/BLACK-SCORP10/url-status-checker) by **BLACK-SCORP10** and was later enhanced by **matteocapricci**. The original authors are credited in the program banner and in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file. The project is maintained for the **FOSSSoC-S1** contribution season.

## Features

- Check a single URL or a list of URLs from a text file.
- Use asynchronous HTTP requests for list checks.
- Follow redirects and show the final destination.
- Display the HTTP status, response time, and resolved IP address for each URL.
- Organise results into status-class sections: 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, and invalid.
- Colour-coded terminal output with a progress bar for list runs.
- Use `--no-colour` to disable coloured terminal output.
- Use `--quiet` to suppress the startup banner and progress bar while keeping the report visible.
- Save the report to a text file.
- Save completed scan results to an atomic checkpoint after each URL finishes.
- Resume interrupted scans without rechecking completed URLs; checkpoint inputs are validated before reuse.
- Print a summary line at the end of every run.
- Simple command-line interface with built-in help.

```

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10 or newer**
- **pip**
- **Git** (to clone the repository)
- Network access to the URLs you want to check

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/PingPanda.git
   cd PingPanda
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

   Linux and macOS:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Windows PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. Install the runtime dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For development and for running the test suite, install the development
   dependencies instead:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

Check a single URL:

```bash
python url-status-checker.py -d https://example.com
```

Check a list of URLs:

```bash
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt
```

Retry transient failures with exponential backoff:

```bash
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt --retries 3 --retry-delay 1
```

The command allows three retries after the initial request. Retry delays are
approximately 1, 2, and 4 seconds. Connection failures, timeouts, and
transient HTTP responses (`408`, `429`, `502`, `503`, and `504`) are retried;
permanent responses such as `404` are not.

Save the report to a file:

```bash
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt -o results.txt
```

Resume an interrupted scan using the default checkpoint:

```powershell
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt --resume
```

Choose a custom checkpoint path:

```powershell
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt --checkpoint .\\state\\scan.json
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt --checkpoint .\\state\\scan.json --resume
```

PingPanda saves progress after each completed URL to `.pingpanda-checkpoint.json` by default. A checkpoint is tied to the exact ordered URL list. If the input changes or is reordered, resume stops with a validation error rather than applying results to the wrong URLs.

Show the built-in help:

```bash
python url-status-checker.py --help
```

A list file contains one URL per line:

```text
https://example.com
https://github.com
https://python.org
```

### Command-line options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-d`, `--domain` | Check a single URL or domain |
| `-l`, `--list` | Check every URL in a text file, one per line |
| `-o`, `--output` | Save the report to a file |
| `--format` | Export report format: `text` (default), `json`, `csv`, or `markdown` |
| `--summary-only` | Export summary statistics and latency percentiles only |
| `--checkpoint PATH` | Choose where scan progress is saved (default: `.pingpanda-checkpoint.json`) |
| `--resume` | Resume from the selected checkpoint, skipping completed URLs |
| `--retries N` | Retry transient failures up to `N` times after the initial request (default: `0`) |
| `--retry-delay SECONDS` | Initial delay before retrying; each later delay doubles (default: `1`) |
| `--max-concurrent N` | Maximum number of URLs checked concurrently (default: `10`) |
| `-v`, `--version` | Show version information |
| `--quiet` | Suppress the startup banner and progress bar |
| `--no-colour` | Disable coloured terminal output |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show the help text |

Provide one input source, either `-d` or `-l`, for each run.

You can combine these options:

Suppress the banner and progress bar:

```bash
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt --quiet
```

Disable terminal colours:

```bash
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt --no-colour
```

Use both options together:

```bash
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt --quiet --no-colour
```

Quiet mode still displays the final report.
### Structured Export Formats

PingPanda supports multi-format reporting via `--format`:

```bash
# JSON export with latency percentiles and URL records
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt --format json -o scan.json

# RFC 4180 CSV export for spreadsheets and data processing
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt --format csv -o scan.csv

# GitHub Flavored Markdown report for PR summaries or CI/CD dashboards
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt --format markdown -o scan.md

# Summary only (latency percentiles and availability without detailed records)
python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt --format json --summary-only -o summary.json
```

Whenever a report file is saved, a confirmation message with the destination path is printed to the terminal:
```text
[Report] Saved JSON report to scan.json
```

#### Metrics & Definitions

* **Availability Rate**: Percentage of scanned URLs that returned a valid HTTP response (1xx–5xx) versus network, DNS, or socket timeout failures.
* **Latency Percentiles**:
  * **Min**: Minimum observed response latency across checked endpoints.
  * **Mean**: Arithmetic mean (average) response latency across checked endpoints.
  * **p50 (Median)**: 50th percentile latency; 50% of requests responded faster than this value.
  * **p95**: 95th percentile latency; identifies tail response degradation for slower endpoints.
  * **p99**: 99th percentile peak latency; highlights extreme outliers and near-worst-case response times.
  * **Max**: Maximum observed response latency across checked endpoints.
* **Failure Diagnostics**: Categorizes unreachable endpoints into actionable reasons: `DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR`, `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`, `CONNECTION_REFUSED`, `SSL_CERTIFICATE_ERROR`, and `HTTP_PROTOCOL_ERROR`.

### Report format

Every checked URL becomes one line of the report:

```text
[Status: 200] [Time: 123.456 ms] [IP: 93.184.216.34:443] https://example.com [Redirect: None]
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Status` | HTTP status code of the response, or `Invalid` when the URL could not be reached |
| `Time` | Response time in milliseconds |
| `IP` | Resolved address and port of the host |
| `URL` | The URL that was checked |
| `Redirect` | Final URL and its address when the server redirected, `None` otherwise |

Results are grouped under headings such as `2XX`, `4XX`, and `INVALID`. The run
ends with a summary line:

```text
Checked: 3 | 1xx: 0 | 2xx: 2 | 3xx: 0 | 4xx: 1 | 5xx: 0 | Failed: 0
```

The `-o` option writes the report to a file without the colours.

### Periodic checks

On systems that provide the `watch` command, the tool can be run repeatedly:

```bash
watch -n 72000 python url-status-checker.py -l urls.txt
```

## Development

Run the whole test suite:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Run a single test file or a single test:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py
python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py::test_version_option_prints_a_version
```

The suite does not use the public internet. HTTP responses are simulated, and a
temporary server on `localhost` is used where a real socket is needed.

### 2. How to Raise a New Issue & Work on It
Found an unlisted bug, edge case, or have an idea for an awesome new CLI feature or test suite expansion? You are strongly encouraged to propose it!

#### Step A: Check Existing Issues & PRs
Before creating a new issue, search the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/tkmfoss/pingpanda/issues) and [Pull Requests Tab](https://github.com/tkmfoss/pingpanda/pulls) to make sure someone else hasn't already reported, claimed, or fixed it. Duplicate issues will be closed.

#### Step B: Open an Issue with a Template
1. Go to [New Issue](https://github.com/tkmfoss/pingpanda/issues/new/choose).
2. Choose either **Bug Report** or **Feature Request**.
3. Fill out all template sections: steps to reproduce, expected vs observed behavior, relevant files, and your proposed approach.

#### Step C: Mentor Review & Difficulty Assignment
- A project mentor (`@hrudulmmn` / `@ganes4real` / `@ras-al`) will review your proposal to verify that it is constructive, non-trivial, and fits the tool.
- If approved, the mentor will tag your issue with:
  - `soc-s1` label (mandatory for automated leaderboard tracking).
  - The appropriate difficulty tier: `level:easy` (10 pts), `level:medium` (25 pts), or `level:hard` (50 pts).
- ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** **Do not start coding or submit a PR until a mentor has reviewed and labeled the issue!** PRs linked to unapproved or unlabeled issues cannot be scored by the automated leaderboard.

#### Step D: Claim and Begin Working
- As soon as the mentor adds the labels, comment `/claim` on the issue to assign yourself.
- The standard **1-Issue Rule** applies (you cannot claim if you already have an active assigned issue).
- Your **tiered inactivity clock (3 days for Easy, 5 days for Medium/Hard)** begins once assigned.
